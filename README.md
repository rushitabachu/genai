Dr. Morgan is an excellent heart surgeonâ€”the best in town. However, having spent most of their life in Europe, their English has become a bit rusty. Imagine a scenario where Taylor, a non-native 
speaker with a very bad cold, struggles to spell "phlegm." How convenient it would be if they could simply say "flem" and still be understood perfectly. Or consider a situation where Dr. Morgan 
tries to convey that Taylor can expect the fever to get worse before it gets better but ends up saying something like, "fever first more bad but next better." How nice it would be to have a Gen AI 
superhero save the day!

Your task, as a seasoned Gen AI Engineer, is to bridge the communication gap between Dr. Morgan and their patients by correcting grammar, fixing spelling mistakes, and articulating their 
intended meaning clearly and verbosely.
